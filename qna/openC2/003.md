## OpenC2
OpenC2 *Actuator Profiles* specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in
the context of specific actuator functions. Cyber defense components, devices,
systems and/or instances will typically implement multiple profiles. A profile
refines the meaning of the OpenC2 language elements (actions, targets, command
arguments, results) used to perform the actuator function, and often defines
additional elements that are relevant and/or unique to that function.
